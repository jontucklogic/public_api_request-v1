# Project 5 - Public API Requests

## Project Details
* The page loads up and the user is automatically presented with twelve user profiles on the page.

* The profile data is brought in from a Random User Generator API, using the built in `fetch` method in JS

* Each profile is displayed with the person's thumbnail image of themself, their full name, email, and city or
  other location

* You can also click on an individual profile to view more information about them displayed in a modal pop-up like  window. Some more information are viewable about that person such as their cell number, their full detailed address, and their birthday

* If you also like to find a certain profile by their name, a search field is available in the upper right corner of the page. 

* Once the individual modal window is open, you can instead of reverting back to the original screen with all the profiles, toggle through each profile using the ***previous*** and ***next*** buttons

## Added Styles
* A gradient-watercolor image is added to background.
