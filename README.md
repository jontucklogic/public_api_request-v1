# Project 5 - Public API Requests

## Project Details
* The page loads up and the user is automatically 
  presented with twelve user profiles on the page.
* The profile data is brought in from a Random User
  Generator API, using the built in *fetch* method in JS
* Each profile is displayed with the person's thumbnail
  image of themself, their full name, email, and city or
  other location
* You can also click on an individual profile to view 
  more information about them displayed in a modal pop-up like window. Some more information are viewable about that person such as their cell number, their full detailed address, and their birthday
* If you also like to find a certain profile by their 
  name, a search field is available in the upper right corner of the page. 
* Once the individual modal window is open, you can 
  instead of reverting back to the original screen with
  all the profiles, toggle through each profile using the
  *previous* and *next* buttons

## Added Styles
* A simple yet subtle image is added to background of the
  page to give it a more welcoming feeling
